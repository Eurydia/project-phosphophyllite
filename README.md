# Phosphophyllite

> Too much to do, too little time.

**Phosphophyllite** is a simple UI wrapper around GitHub's API, and its purpose is to an issue aggregator.

## Motivation

The main motivation for this project is to re-learn the basics of data fetching as phosphophyllite is an aggregrator, it does not support editing or complex interaction beyond data display.

## Development logs

Phosphophyllite is built around [OctokitJS](https://github.com/octokit/octokit.js/). It uses React with typescript as the primary front-end framework. All UI components are handled by MUI.
